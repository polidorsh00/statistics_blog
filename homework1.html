        <h2>What is statistics and why is it useful for cybersecurity?</h2>
        <p>
            Statistics is the scientific discipline that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation,
            and presentation of data. It provides tools and methodologies to extract meaningful insights
            from raw information, identify patterns, and make informed decisions under uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of cybersecurity, statistics is essential for analyzing vast amounts of
            security-related data, such as network traffic logs, system alerts, and user activity patterns.
            Through statistical methods, analysts can detect anomalies, estimate the likelihood of attacks,
            and model risk behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, statistical anomaly detection can help identify unusual login attempts or
            abnormal network flows that may indicate a security breach. Furthermore, statistical reasoning
            supports the evaluation of security measures, allowing professionals to assess the effectiveness
            of intrusion detection systems or predict potential vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, statistics provides the foundation for data-driven decision-making in cybersecurity,
            enabling professionals to move from reactive defense to proactive threat prevention.
